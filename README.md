# 42-Cursus

In Douglas Adams’ book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – H2G2 for short – an advanced alien species builds a super computer. It has only one job: to find the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. After 7 million years of calculation, the computer finds the answer: 42. In geek culture, 42 often represents the answer to a seemingly insuperable problem. This is why 42 is called 42. This is our answer to what IT education should be today and in the future.
